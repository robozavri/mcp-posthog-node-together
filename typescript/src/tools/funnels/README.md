# Funnel Tools

This directory contains tools for working with PostHog funnel insights. Funnels help you visualize user flows and understand where people are getting stuck in your product.

## Available Tools

### 1. get-all-funnels
Lists all funnel insights in a project.

**Parameters:**
- `limit` (optional): Number of funnels to return (default: 100)
- `offset` (optional): Number of funnels to skip
- `search` (optional): Search term to filter funnels by name
- `insight_type` (optional): Filter by insight type

**Example:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "limit": 10,
    "search": "signup"
  }
}
```

### 2. get-funnel
Get a specific funnel insight by ID.

**Parameters:**
- `projectId`: Project ID
- `insightId`: Insight ID of the funnel

**Example:**
```json
{
  "projectId": 123,
  "insightId": 456
}
```

### 3. get-funnel-users
Get users who completed or dropped at a specific funnel step.

**Parameters:**
- `projectId`: Project ID
- `insightId`: Insight ID of the funnel
- `step`: Step number to get users for
- `status`: "completed" or "dropped"
- `limit` (optional): Number of users to return (default: 100)
- `offset` (optional): Number of users to skip

**Example:**
```json
{
  "projectId": 123,
  "insightId": 456,
  "step": 2,
  "status": "dropped",
  "limit": 50
}
```

### 4. get-funnel-user-paths
Get user paths in a funnel for path analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `projectId`: Project ID
- `insightId`: Insight ID of the funnel
- `path_type`: Type of paths to analyze ("leading_to_step", "between_steps", "after_step", "after_drop_off", "before_drop_off")
- `step` (optional): Step number for path analysis
- `previous_step` (optional): Previous step number (required for "between_steps")
- `limit` (optional): Number of paths to return (default: 100)
- `offset` (optional): Number of paths to skip

**Example:**
```json
{
  "projectId": 123,
  "insightId": 456,
  "path_type": "leading_to_step",
  "step": 3,
  "limit": 20
}
```

### 5. execute-funnel-query
Execute SQL or HogQL queries for funnel analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `projectId`: Project ID
- `query`: SQL or HogQL query for funnel analysis
- `query_type` (optional): "sql" or "hogql" (default: "hogql")
- `refresh` (optional): Whether to refresh cached results
- `client_query_id` (optional): Client query ID for tracking

**Example HogQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  event,
  count() as count,
  count() / lag(count()) OVER (ORDER BY step_order) as conversion_rate
FROM events 
WHERE event IN ('page_view', 'sign_up', 'purchase')
GROUP BY event, step_order
ORDER BY step_order
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Funnels Found
If the `get-all-funnels` tool returns no results:

1. **Check if funnels exist**: Make sure you have created funnel insights in your PostHog project first. You can create funnels through the PostHog web interface.

2. **Verify project access**: Ensure your API token has access to the project you're trying to query.

3. **Check API permissions**: Make sure your API token has the necessary permissions to read insights.

4. **Debug mode**: The tool includes debug logging to help identify issues. Check the console output for detailed information about the API calls and responses.

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication errors**: Ensure your API token is valid and has the correct permissions.

2. **Project ID issues**: Make sure you're using the correct project ID.

3. **Insight ID not found**: When using `get-funnel`, ensure the insight ID corresponds to an actual funnel insight.

## Creating Funnels

To create funnels that can be accessed by these tools:

1. Go to your PostHog project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Product Analytics" â†’ "Insights"
3. Click "New Insight" and select "Funnel"
4. Configure your funnel steps and settings
5. Save the funnel

The funnel will then be accessible via the `get-all-funnels` and `get-funnel` tools.

## Funnel Configuration Options

When creating funnels in PostHog, you can configure:

- **Step Order**: Sequential, Strict Order, or Any Order
- **Conversion Rate Calculation**: Overall or Relative to Previous Step
- **Breakdowns**: By event or person properties
- **Exclusion Steps**: Steps to exclude from the funnel
- **Global Filters**: Filters applied to all steps
- **Graph Type**: Conversion Steps, Time to Convert, or Historical Trends
